# Publishing Tips

1. Navigate to <https://github.com/TACITVS/FP_ASM/wiki>.
2. Use “New Page” for each title above.
3. Paste the corresponding Markdown blocks, save, and add sidebar links for navigation.
4. Optionally create additional pages (e.g., “Architecture Notes”) by drawing from `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for deeper dives into ABI rules and SIMD strategies.
